APPLICATION LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong></p><p>THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO YOUR USE OF EACH APPLICATION YOU DOWNLOAD FROM THE LGE SERVICE (EACH, AN “APPLICATION”) AND SUPPLEMENT THE TERMS OF USE. BEFORE USING ANY APPLICATION, CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You acknowledge that the license granted hereunder is granted to you by the provider of the Application (“Application Provider”) and not by LG Electronics, Inc. (“LGE”). If the Application Provider provides an End User License Agreement (“EULA”) with the Application, those terms shall supplement this Application License Agreement. As between you and the Application Provider, any additional or different terms in such EULA shall take precedence over the terms in this Application License Agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that LGE is a third party beneficiary of this Application License Agreement and any EULA, if so provided. You acknowledge and agree that LGE will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third party beneficiary of those agreements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Grant of License: Application Provider hereby grants you a limited, non-transferable license to use the Application on any mobile device product manufactured by LGE and/or its affiliates (“LGE Mobile Device”) and in the manner set forth in the LGE Terms of Use. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Application. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Application, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law. Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Application Provider. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by the Application Provider that replace and/or supplement the original Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. The Application Provider reserves all rights in and to the Application not expressly granted to you under this Application License Agreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that the Application Provider may collect and use technical and related information, gathered in any manner, as part of product support services related to the Application. The Application Provider may use this information solely to improve its products or to provide customized services or technologies to you. The Application Provider may disclose this information to others, but not in a form that personally identifies you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Termination: The license is effective until terminated by you or by the Application Provider. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Application Provider if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of the license, you shall cease all use of the Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Application, including any accompanying documentation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Third Party Material; Objectionable Content: You understand, acknowledge and agree that certain Applications may provide access to products, services, web content or other third-party materials and that LGE is not responsible for such third party content. You agree that LGE is not responsible for examining or evaluating the third party content or the accuracy of such content. LGE does not make any representations or warranties regarding, and accepts no liability in respect of, such third party content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You understand, acknowledge, and agree that by accessing and downloading Applications from the LGE Service that you may encounter material that you may deem explicit or is offensive, indecent or objectionable to you, and that you may not be warned about such material in advance. You agree that your downloading and use of all Applications will be at your sole risk, and LGE shall have no liability to you as a result of any exposure through such Applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND OR NATURE. THE APPLICATION PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT USE OF THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION PROVIDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED OR STATUTORY TERMS, CONDITIONS OR WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY, CORRESPONDENCE WITH DESCRIPTION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE APPLICATION PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARD TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY : TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION PROVIDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND OR FORLOSS OF INFORMATION OR DATA, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSE OR USE OF THE APPLICATION, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF THE APPLICATION PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IS DEEMED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLICATION PROVIDER’S ENTIRE LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACEMENT, REPAIR, OR REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE APPLICATION (IF ANY), AT THE APPLICATION PROVIDER’S OPTION. IN NO EVENT WILL THE APPLICATION PROVIDER BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE APPLICATION PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or the limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the above limitations and exclusions may be limited in their application to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7. You agree that you will not export or re-export the Application or accompanying documentation (or any copies thereof) in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. You agree to comply with all applicable and international export laws and regulations. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use.
