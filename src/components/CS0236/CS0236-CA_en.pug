You are invited to call LG Electronics Canada’s B2B Support Line (1-855-286-2456) and speak with a representative regarding any pertinent support questions. The LG Electronics Canada representative can dispatch an LG authorized service technician to your business to provide the required in-warranty support. You (the customer) must present the technician with proof of delivery or installation, as the technician must provide a copy to LG Electronics Canada. The technician has the right to refuse a repair if the customer does not provide proof of delivery or installation. The unit must have an LG “Model and Serial Tag” visible, as the technician will also take a picture of the serial tag for LG Electronics Canada’s records. Unfortunately, LG Electronics Canada will not cover an LG product with a defaced or missing serial tag. Where a unit is mounted, it is the responsibility of you (the customer) to remove the unit from its mounted position and have it ready for repair when the technician arrives. (The technician will repair the unit, but will not reinstall it.) Refurbished products or products from second hand (reseller) shops will not be covered under warranty. Consult the owner’s manual that was provided with your product at the time of purchase for full terms and conditions. For enhanced warranty services, please speak with your Distributor or LG Key account manager about LG’s white glove service.
