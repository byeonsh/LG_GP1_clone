This warranty is not transferable and applies to the original purchaser only. No LG employee, product retailer or Authorised Service Centre has authority to vary the terms of this warranty.

Refurbished parts may be used to repair the goods.

This warranty is not transferable and applies to the original purchaser only. No LG employee, product retailer or Authorised Service Centre has authority to vary the terms of this warranty. Goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be used to repair the goods.

Transportation costs to and from the Service Centre are not covered by this Warranty. Service Centers are open during normal business hours, Monday to Friday. LG's Authorised Service Centre may charge an additional fee for service outside these hours.
